         interacting with presentation-oriented web services. It has been produced through the efforts of
         the Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) OASIS Technical Committee. It is based on the requirements
         gathered and on the concrete proposals made to the committee.
      </p><p>Scenarios motivating the WSRP functionality include:
         </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Content hosts, such as portal servers, providing Portlets as presentation-oriented web services
                  that can be used by aggregation engines.
               </p></li><li><p>Aggregating frameworks, including portal servers, consuming presentation-oriented web services
                  offered by content providers and integrating them into the framework.
               </p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>More information on WSRP can be found on the

         It is suggested that you read the
         <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/10539/wsrp-primer-1.0.html">primer</a>
         for a good, and albeit technical overview of WSRP.

         to help with the WSRP interoperability. You can refer to terms defined in that document in
         this section.
      </p><p>GateIn provides a Simple level of support for our WSRP Producer except that out-of-band registration
         is not currently handled. eXo Platform supports the in-band registration and persistent local state (which are
         defined at the Complex level).
      </p><p>On the Consumer side, GateIn provides a Medium level of support for WSRP, except that eXo Platform only handles the
         HTML markup (as GateIn itself does not handle other markup types). eXo Platform supports the explicit portlet
         cloning and provides the full support the PortletManagement interface.
      </p><p>As far as caching goes, eXo Platform has Level 1 Producer and Consumer. eXo Platform supports the Cookie handling properly on the
         Consumer and our Producer that requires initialization of cookies. eXo Platform does not support custom window states or modes. However, eXo Platform supports CSS on both the Producer (though it's more a function of the portlets than inherent Producer
         capability) and Consumer.
      </p><p>While eXo Platform provides a complete implementation of WSRP 1.0, you need to go through the

         Committee and Community at large).

            Only JSR-286 (Portlet 2.0) portlets can be made remotable as the mechanism to expose a portlet to WSRP
            relies on the JSR-286-only functionality.
         </p></div><p>GateIn does
         <span class="bold"><strong>NOT</strong></span> expose local portlets for consumption
         by remote WSRP consumers by default. To make a portlet remotely available, it must be made "remotable" by marking
         it as such in the associated
         <code class="filename">portlet.xml</code>. This is accomplished by using a specific
         <code class="code">org.gatein.pc.remotable container-runtime-option</code>. Setting its value to
         <code class="code">true</code>
         makes the portlet available for the remote consumption, while setting its value to
         <code class="code">false</code>
         will not publish it remotely. As specifying the remotable status for a portlet is optional, you do not need to
         do anything if you do not need your portlet to be available remotely.
      </p><p>In the following example, the "BasicPortlet" portlet is specified as being remotable.
      </p><div class="example"><a id="d0e4659"/><p class="title"><b>Example 7.1. </b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?&gt;
&lt;portlet-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_2_0.xsd"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_2_0.xsd http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_2_0.xsd"
             version="2.0"&gt;
&lt;portlet-app&gt;
   &lt;portlet&gt;
      &lt;portlet-name&gt;BasicPortlet&lt;/portlet-name&gt;

      ...

      &lt;container-runtime-option&gt;
         &lt;name&gt;org.gatein.pc.remotable&lt;/name&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/container-runtime-option&gt;
   &lt;/portlet&gt;
&lt;/portlet-app&gt;</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"/><p>
         It is also possible to specify that all the portlets declared within a given portlet application to be
         remotable by default. This is done by specifying the
         <code class="code">
            container-runtime-option
         </code>
         at the
         <code class="code">portlet-app</code>
         element level. Individual portlets can override that value to not be remotely exposed. Let's look at an
         example:
      </p><div class="example"><a id="d0e4670"/><p class="title"><b>Example 7.2. </b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?&gt;

             xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_2_0.xsd http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_2_0.xsd"
             version="2.0"&gt;
&lt;portlet-app&gt;

   &lt;portlet&gt;
      &lt;portlet-name&gt;RemotelyExposedPortlet&lt;/portlet-name&gt;
      ...
   &lt;/portlet&gt;
   &lt;portlet&gt;
      &lt;portlet-name&gt;NotRemotelyExposedPortlet&lt;/portlet-name&gt;
      ...
      &lt;container-runtime-option&gt;
         &lt;name&gt;org.gatein.pc.remotable&lt;/name&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;false&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/container-runtime-option&gt;
   &lt;/portlet&gt;

   &lt;container-runtime-option&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;org.gatein.pc.remotable&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/container-runtime-option&gt;
&lt;/portlet-app&gt;
            </pre></div></div><br class="example-break"/><p>
         In the example above, two portlets are defined. The
         <code class="code">org.gatein.pc.remotable container-runtime-option</code>
         is set to
         <code class="code">true</code>
         at the
         <code class="code">portlet-app</code>
         level, meaning that all portlets defined in this particular portlet application are exposed remotely by GateIn's
         WSRP
         producer.
         Note, however, that it is possible to override the default behavior: specifying a value for the
         <code class="code">org.gatein.pc.remotable container-runtime-option</code>
         at the
         <code class="code">portlet</code>
         level will take precedence over the default. In the example above, the
         <code class="varname">RemotelyExposedPortlet</code>
         inherits the remotable status defined at the
         <code class="code">portlet-app</code>
         level since it does not specify a value for the<code class="code">org.gatein.pc.remotable container-runtime-option</code>.
         The<code class="varname">NotRemotelyExposedPortlet</code>, however, overrides the default behavior and is not remotely
         exposed. Note that in the absence of a top-level
         <code class="code">org.gatein.pc.remotable container-runtime-option</code>
         value set to<code class="code">true</code>, portlets are NOT remotely exposed.

Most of them require you to specify

            To consume the WSRP portlets exposed by a remote producer, GateIn's WSRP consumer needs to
            know how to access that remote producer. One can configure access to a remote producer using the WSRP Producer
            descriptors. Alternatively, a portlet is provided to configure the remote producers.
         </p><p>
            Once a remote producer has been configured, the portlets that it exposes are then available in the
            Application Registry to be added to categories and then to pages.
         </p><p>
            As a way to test the WSRP producer service and to check that the portlets that you want to expose remotely
            are correctly published via WSRP, a default consumer named
            <code class="literal">self</code>, that consumes the portlets exposed by GateIn's producer,
            has been configured.

            Let's work through the steps of defining access to a remote producer so that its portlets can be
            consumed within GateIn. You need to configure access to the Oracle's public WSRP producer. First,
            examine how to do so using the configuration portlet and then show how the same result can be
            accomplished with a producer descriptor, though it is far easier to do so via the configuration portlet.

               Some WSRP producers do not support the chunked encoding that is activated by default by JBoss WS. If your
               producer does not support the chunked encoding, your consumer will not be able to properly connect to the
               producer. This will manifest itself with the following error:
               <code class="code">Caused by: org.jboss.ws.WSException: Invalid HTTP server response [503] - Service Unavailable</code>.

               GateIn provides a portlet to configure access (among other functions) to remote WSRP Producers
               graphically. However, it is not installed by default, so the first thing you need to do is to install
               the WSRP configuration portlet using the Application Registry.
            </p><p>
               Use the usual procedure to log in as a Portal administrator and go to the Application Registry.
               With the default installment, you can just go to
               <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://localhost:8080/portal/login?initialURI=%2Fportal%2Fprivate%2Fclassic%2FwsrpConfiguration&amp;username=root&amp;password=gtn">
                  http://localhost:8080/portal/login?initialURI=%2Fportal%2Fprivate%2Fclassic%2FwsrpConfigurationp&amp;username=root&amp;password=gtn
               </a>
            </p><p>
               You should see a screen similar to:
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/config_init.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
               This screen presents all the configured Consumers associated with their status and possible actions on
               them. A Consumer can be active or inactive. Activating a Consumer means that it is ready to act as a
               portlet provider. Also, note that a Consumer can be marked as required refreshing, meaning that the
               information held about it might not be up to date and refreshing it from the remote Producer might be a
               good idea. This can happen for several reasons: the service description for that remote Producer has not
               been fetched yet, the cached version has expired or modifications have been made to the configuration
               that could potentially invalidate it; thus, it is required to validate the information again.
            </p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>
                  The WSRP configuration did not use to be installed by default in previous versions of GateIn.
                  We include here the legacy instructions on how to install this portlet in case you ever need to
                  re-install it.
               </p><p>
                  Use the usual procedure to log in as a Portal administrator and go to the Application
                  Registry. With the default install, you can just go to
                  <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://localhost:8080/portal/login?initialURI=%2Fportal%2Fprivate%2Fclassic%2Fadministration%2Fregistry&amp;username=root&amp;password=gtn">

                  </a>
                  Add the WSRP Configuration portlet to the Administration category. If you use the Import Applications
                  functionality, the WSRP Configuration portlet will be automatically added to the Administration
                  category.
               </p><p>
                  Now that the portlet is added to a category, it can be added to a page and used. We recommend adding
                  it to the same page as the Application Registry as operations relating to WSRP and adding portlets to
                  categories are somewhat related as we will see. Go ahead and add the WSRP Configuration portlet to the
                  page using the standard procedure.
               </p></div><p>
               Next, you need create a new Consumer called <code class="literal">oracle</code>. Type
               "<code class="literal">oracle</code>" in
               the "Create a consumer named:" field, then click "Create consumer":
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/config_create.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
               You should now see a form allowing you to enter/modify the information about the Consumer.
               Set the cache expiration value to 300 seconds, leave the default timeout value for web services (WS)
               operations and enter the WSDL URL for the producer in the text field
               and press the "Refresh &amp; Save" button:
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/config_wsdl.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
               This will retrieve the service description associated with the Producer which WSRP interface is described
               by the WSDL file found at the URL you just entered. In this case, querying the service description will
               allow us to learn that the Producer requires registration but did not request any registration property:
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/config_refresh.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
               The Consumer for the
               <code class="literal">oracle</code>
               Producer should now be available as a portlet provider and be ready to be used.
            </p><p>
               Now, assuming that the producer required a value for an
               <code class="literal">email</code>
               registration property, GateIn's WSRP consumer would have informed you that you were missing some
               information:
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/config_missing.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
               </p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>At this point, there is no automated way to learn about which possible values (if any) are
                     expected by the remote Producer. Sometimes, the possible values will be indicated in the
                     registration
                     property description but this is not always the case. Please refer to the specific Producer's
                     documentation.
                  </p></div><p>
               If you entered "<code class="literal">example@example.com</code>" as the value for the registration property and
               press "Save &amp;

               The file as shown above specifies access to two producers:

               If we go back to the Application Registry and examine the available portlets by clicking the

               These portlets are available to be used. For example, the regular portlets can be used in
               categories and added to pages. If you use the Import Applications functionality, they will also be
               automatically imported into categories based on the keywords they define.

               More specifically, if you want to add the WSRP portlet to a category, you can access these portlets by

            </p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>It is important to note how the XML consumers configuration file is processed. It is the first
                  time the WSRP service starts and the associated information is then put under control of JCR (Java
                  Content Repository). The subsequent launches of the WSRP service will use the JCR-stored information for
                  all producers that are already known to GateIn. More specifically, the
                  <code class="filename">wsrp-consumers-config.xml</code>
                  file is scanned for producer identifiers.
                  Any identifier that is already known will be by-passed and the JCR information associated with this
                  remote producer will be used. The information defined at the XML level is only processed for producer
                  definition for which no information is already present in JCR. Therefore, if you wish to delete a
                  producer configuration, you need to delete the associated information in the database (this can be
                  accomplished using the configuration portlet as shown in
                  <a href="wsrp.html#consumer_gui" title="7.6.2.1. Using the configuration portlet">Section 7.6.2.1, “Using the configuration portlet”</a>)

                  remove the associated information in

                  (if such information exists) as the producer will be re-created the next time the WSRP is launched if
                  that information is not removed.

            </p><p>First, you need to provide an identifier for the producer we are configuring so that you can refer to it
               afterwards. This is accomplished via the mandatory
               <code class="literal">id</code>
               attribute of the
               <code class="literal">&lt;wsrp-producer&gt;</code>
               element.
            </p><p>GateIn also needs to learn about the remote producer's end-points to be able to connect to the
               remote web services and perform WSRP invocations. This is accomplished by specifying the URL for the
               WSDL description for the remote WSRP service, using the
               <code class="literal">&lt;endpoint-wsdl-url&gt;</code>
               element.
            </p><p>Both the
               <code class="literal">id</code>
               attribute and
               <code class="literal">&lt;endpoint-wsdl-url&gt;</code>
               elements are required for a functional remote producer configuration.
            </p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="wsrp-consumer_configuration-Configure_access_to_remote_producers_via_XML-Optional_configuration"/>7.6.3.2. Optional configuration</h4></div></div></div><p>It is also possible to provide addtional configuration. In some cases, the additional configuration might be important to
               establish a proper connection to the remote producer.
            </p><p>One such optional configuration concerns caching. To prevent useless roundtrips between the local
               consumer and the remote producer, it is possible to cache some of the information sent by the producer
               (such as the list of offered portlets) for a given duration. The rate at which the information is
               refreshed is
               defined by the
               <code class="literal">expiration-cache</code>
               attribute of the
               <code class="literal">&lt;wsrp-producer&gt;</code>
               element which specifies the refreshing period in seconds. For example, providing a value of 120 for
               expiration-cache means that the producer information will not be refreshed for 2 minutes after it has
               been somehow accessed. If no value is provided, GateIn will always access the remote producer
               regardless of whether the remote information has changed or not. Since, in most instances, the
               information provided by the producer does not change often. It is recommended that you use this caching
               facility to minimize the bandwidth usage.
            </p><p>It is also possible to define a timeout after which the WS operations are considered as failed. This is
               helpful to avoid blocking the WSRP service, waiting forever on the service that does not answer. Use the
               <code class="literal">ws-timeout</code>
               attribute of the
               <code class="literal">&lt;wsrp-producer&gt;</code>
               element to specify how many milliseconds the WSRP service will wait for a response from the remote
               producer before timing out and giving up.
            </p><p>Additionally, some producers require consumers to register with them before authorizing them to access
               their offered portlets. If you know that information beforehand, you can provide the required
               registration information in the producer configuration so that the consumer can register with the remote
               producer when required.
               </p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>At this time, though, only simple String properties are supported and it is not possible to
                     configure the complex registration data. This should, however, be sufficient for most cases.
                  </p></div><p>
            </p><p>Registration configuration is done via the
               <code class="literal">&lt;registration-data&gt;</code>
               element. Since GateIn can generate the mandatory information for you, if the remote producer does
               not require any registration properties, you only need to provide an empty
               <code class="literal">&lt;registration-data&gt;</code>
               element. Values for the registration properties
               required by the remote producer can be provided via the
               <code class="literal">&lt;property&gt;</code>
               elements. See the example below for more details. Additionally, you can override the default consumer
               name automatically provided by GateIn via the
               <code class="literal">&lt;consumer-name&gt;</code>
               element. If you select to provide a consumer name, please remember that this should uniquely identify
               your consumer.

               Producers often offer several levels of service depending on consumers' subscription levels (for
               example). This is implemented at the WSRP level with the registration concept: producers can assert which
               level of service to provide to consumers based on the values of given registration properties.
            </p><p>
               There might also be cases where you just want to update the registration information because it has
               changed. For example, the producer required you to provide a valid email and the previously email
               address is not valid anymore and needs to be updated.
            </p><p>
               It is therefore sometimes necessary to modify the registration that concretizes the service agreement
               between a consumer and a producer. Let's take the example of the producer requiring an email you
               configured in
               <a href="wsrp.html#consumer_gui" title="7.6.2.1. Using the configuration portlet">Section 7.6.2.1, “Using the configuration portlet”</a>.
               If you recall, the producer was requiring registration and required a value to be provided for the
               <code class="literal">email</code>
               property.
            </p><p>
               Suppose that you want to update the email address that you provided to the remote producer. To do so, you
               need to tell the producer that our registration data have been modified. Let's see how to do this.
               In case that you want to configure access to the producer as previously described, please go to the configuration screen for
               the
               <code class="literal">self</code>
               producer and modify the value of
               <code class="literal">email</code>
               to
               <code class="literal">foo@example.com</code>
               instead of<code class="literal">example@example.com</code>:
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/modify_reg_start.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
               Now, click "Update properties" to save the change. A "Modify registration" button should now appear to
               let you send the new data to the remote producer:
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/modify_reg_modify.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
               Click this new button and, if everything went well and your updated registration has been accepted by
               the remote producer, you should see something similar to:
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/modify_reg_end.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
            </p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="reg_mod_error"/>7.7.1.2. Registration modification on producer error</h4></div></div></div><p>
               It can also happen that a producer administrator decided to change its requirement for registered
               consumers. In this case, invoking operations on the producer will be failed with an
               <code class="exceptionname">OperationFailedFault</code>. GateIn will attempt to help you in this
               situation. Let's walk through an example using the
               <code class="literal">self</code>
               producer. Let's assume that
               registration is requiring a valid value for an
               <code class="literal">email</code>
               registration property (as we have seen so far). If you go to the configuration screen for this producer,
               you should see:
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/config_self.png" align="middle"/></div><p>

               Now suppose that the administrator of the producer also requires a value to be provided for a
               <code class="literal">name</code>
               registration property. We will actually see how to perform this operation
               in GateIn when we examine how to configure GateIn's producer in
               <a href="wsrp.html#producer_config" title="7.8. Configuring GateIn's WSRP Producer">Section 7.8, “Configuring GateIn's WSRP Producer”</a>.
               Operations with this producer will now be failed. If you suspect that a registration modification is required,
               you should go to the configuration screen for this remote producer and refresh the information held by
               the consumer by pressing "Refresh &amp; Save":
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/modify_reg_self.png" align="middle"/></div><p>

               As you can see, the configuration screen now shows the currently held registration information and
               the expected information from the producer. Enter a value for the
               <code class="literal">name</code>
               property
               and then click "Modify registration". If all went on well and the producer accepted your new registration
               data, you should see something similar to:
               </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/modify_reg_self_end.png" align="middle"/></div><p>

               </p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>As of WSRP 1, it is rather difficult to ascertain what caused an
                     <code class="exceptionname">OperationFailedFault</code>
                     as it is the generic exception returned by
                     producers if something did not quite happen as expected during a method invocation. This means that
                     <code class="exceptionname">OperationFailedFault</code>
                     can be caused by several different reasons, one
                     of them being a request to modify the registration data. Please take a look at the log files to see
                     if you can gather more information as to what happened. WSRP 2 introduces an exception that is
                     specific to a request to modify registrations, thus reducing the ambiguity that currently exists.

Exporting a portlet allows a consumer to get
            an opaque representation of the portlet which can then be use by the corresponding import operation to
            reconstitute it. It is mostly used in migration scenarios during batch operations. Since GateIn
            does not currently support automated migration of portal data, the functionality that we provide as part of
            WSRP 2 is necessarily less complete than it could be with full portal support.
         </p><p>The import/export implementation in GateIn 3.1 allows users to export portlets from a given consumer.
            These portlets can then be used to replace existing content on pages. This is accomplished by assiging
            previously exported portlets to replace the content displayed by windows on the portal's pages. Let us walk
            through an example to make things clearer.
         </p><p>Clicking the "Export" action for a given consumer will display the list of portlets currently made
            available by this specific consumer. An example of such a list is shown below:
         </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/export_portlet_list.png" align="middle"/></div><p>Once portlets have been selected, they can be exported by clicking the "Export" button thus making
            them available for later import:
         </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/export_done.png" align="middle"/></div><p>You can re-import the portlets directly by pressing the "Use for import" button or, on the Consumers list
            page, using the "Import" action for a given consumer. Let's assume that you used that second option and that
            you currently have several available sets of previously exported portlets to import from. After clicking the
            action link, you should see a screen similar to the one below:</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/export_list.png" align="middle"/></div><p>As you can see this screen presents the list of available exports with available operations for each.
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>View: displays the export details as previously seen when the export was first performed</p></li><li><p>Delete: deletes the selected export, asking you for confirmation first</p></li><li><p>Use for import: selects the export to import portlets from</p></li></ul></div><p>
         </p><p>Once you have selected an export to import from, you will see a screen similar to the one below:</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/import_start.png" align="middle"/></div><p>The screen displays the list of available exported portlets for the previously selected export. You can
            select which portlet you want to import by checking the checkbox next to its name. Next, you need to select
            the content of which window the imported portlet will replace. This process is done in three steps. Let's
            assume in this example that you have the following page called
            <code class="literal">page1</code>
            and containing two windows called
            <code class="literal">NetUnity WSRP 2 Interop - Cache Markup (remote)</code>
            and
            <code class="literal">/samples-remotecontroller-portlet.RemoteControl (remote)</code>
            as shown below:</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/import_original_page.png" align="middle"/></div><p>In this example, we want to replace the content of the
            <code class="literal">/samples-remotecontroller-portlet.RemoteControl (remote)</code>
            by the content of the
            <code class="literal">/ajaxPortlet.JSFAJAXPortlet</code>
            portlet that we previously exported. To do so, we will check the checkbox next to the
            <code class="literal">/ajaxPortlet.JSFAJAXPortlet</code>
            portlet name to indicate that we want to import its data and then select the
            <code class="literal">page1</code>
            in the list of available pages. The screen will then refresh to display the list of available windows on
            that page, similar to the one seen below:
         </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/import_selected_page.png" align="middle"/></div><p>Note that, at this point, we still need to select the window which content we want to replace before
            being able to complete the import operation. Let's select the
            <code class="literal">/samples-remotecontroller-portlet.RemoteControl (remote)</code>
            window, at which point the "Import" button will become enabled, indicating that we now have all the
            necessary data to perform the import. If all goes well, pressing that button should result in a screen
            similar to the one below:
         </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/import_success.png" align="middle"/></div><p>If you now take a look at the
            <code class="literal">page1</code>
            page, you should now see that the content
            <code class="literal">/samples-remotecontroller-portlet.RemoteControl (remote)</code>
            window has been replaced by the content of the
            <code class="literal">/ajaxPortlet.JSFAJAXPortlet</code>
            imported portlet and the window renamed appropriately:
         </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/import_modified_page.png" align="middle"/></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="wsrp-Consumers_maintenance-Erase_local_registration_data"/>7.7.4. Erasing local registration data</h3></div></div></div><p>
            There are rare cases where it might be required to erase the local information without being able to
            deregister first. This is the case when a consumer is registered with a producer that has been modified by
            its administrator to not require the registration anymore. If that ever was to happen (most likely, it will not),
            you can erase the local registration information from the consumer so that it can resume interacting with
            the remote producer. To do so, click the "Erase local registration" button next to the registration context
            information on the consumer configuration screen:
         </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/erase_registration.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Warning:</em></span>
            This operation is dangerous as it can result in inability to interact with the remote producer if invoked
            when not required. A warning screen will be displayed to give you a chance to change your mind:
         </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/erase_registration_warning.png" align="middle"/></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="producer_config"/>7.8. Configuring GateIn's WSRP Producer</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="producer_config-Overview"/>7.8.1. Overview</h3></div></div></div><p>
            You can configure the behavior of Portal's WSRP Producer by using the WSRP administration interface, which
            is the preferred way, or by editing the
            <code class="filename">$GATEIN_HOME/wsrp-producer.war/WEB-INF/conf/producer/config.xml</code>
            file. Several aspects can be modified with respects to whether the registration is required for consumers to
            access the Producer's services. An XML Schema for the configuration format is available at
            <code class="filename">
               $GATEIN_HOME/lib/wsrp-integration-api-$WSRP_VERSION.jar/xsd/gatein_wsrp_producer_1_0.xsd

            The default producer configuration requires consumers to register with it before providing access to its
            services but does not require any specific registration properties (apart from what is mandated by the
            WSRP standard). It does, however, require consumers to be registered before sending them a full service
            description. This means that our WSRP producer will not provide the list of offered portlets and other
            capabilities to unregistered consumers. The producer also uses the default
            <code class="classname">RegistrationPolicy</code>
            paired with the default
            <code class="classname">RegistrationPropertyValidator</code>. You need to look into property
            validators in greater detail later in<a href="wsrp.html#registration-configuration" title="7.8.3. Registration configuration">Section 7.8.3, “Registration configuration”</a>. This allows you to customize how Portal's WSRP Producer decides whether a given registration property
            is valid or not.
         </p><p>
            GateIn provides a web interface to configure the producer's behavior. You can access it
            by clicking the "Producer Configuration" tab of the "WSRP" page of the "admin" portal. Here's what you
            should see with the default configuration:
            </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/producer_default.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
            As expected, you can specify whether or not the producer will send the full service description to
            unregistered consumers, and, if it requires registration, which
            <code class="classname">RegistrationPolicy</code>
            to use (and, if needed, which
            <code class="classname">RegistrationPropertyValidator</code>), along with required
            registration property description for which consumers must provide acceptable values to
            register successfully.

            To require consumers to register with the Portal's producer before interacting with it, you need to
            configure the Portal's behavior with respect to registration. Registration is optional, as registration
            properties. The producer can require registration without passing any registration
            properties in case of the default configuration. Let's configure our producer starting with a blank
            state:
            </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/producer_blank.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
            eXo Platform will allow unregistered consumers to see the list of offered portlets, so the first checkbox
            ("Access to full service description requires consumers to be registered") is unchecked. You will, however,
            specify that consumers will need to be registered to be able to interact with our producer. Check the second
            checkbox ("Requires registration. Modifying this information will trigger invalidation of consumer
            registrations."). The screen should now refresh and display:
            </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/WSRP/producer_registration.png" align="middle"/></div><p>
            You can specify the fully-qualified name for your
            <code class="classname">RegistrationPolicy</code>
            and
            <code class="classname">RegistrationPropertyValidator</code>
            there. We will keep the default value. See
            <a href="wsrp.html#custom_registration" title="7.8.3.1. Customization of Registration handling behavior">Section 7.8.3.1, “Customization of Registration handling behavior”</a>
            for more details. Let's add, however, a registration property called
            <code class="literal">email</code>. Click "Add property" and enter the appropriate information in the fields,

               Registration handling behavior can be customized by users to suit their Producer needs. This is
               accomplished by providing an implementation of the
               <code class="classname">RegistrationPolicy</code>
               interface. This interface defines methods that are called by Portal's Registration service so that
               decisions can be made appropriately. A default registration policy that provides basic
               behavior is provided and should be enough for most user needs.
            </p><p>
               While the default registration policy provides the default behavior for most registration-related aspects,
               there is still one aspect that requires configuration: whether a given value for a registration property
               is acceptable by the WSRP Producer. This is accomplished by plugging a
               <code class="classname">RegistrationPropertyValidator</code>
               in the default registration policy. This allows you to define their own validation mechanism.
            </p><p>
               Please refer to the
               <span class="trademark">Javadoc</span>™
               for
               <code class="classname">org.jboss.portal.registration.RegistrationPolicy</code>
               and
               <code class="classname">org.jboss.portal.Registration.policies.RegistrationPropertyValidator</code>
               for more
               details on what is expected of each method.
            </p><p>Defining a registration policy is required for the producer to be correctly configured. This is
               accomplished by specifying the qualified class name of the registration policy. Since we anticipate that
               most users will use the default registration policy, it is possible to provide the class
               name of your custom property validator instead of customizing the default registration policy behavior.
               Note that property validators are only used by the default policy.

               </p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>Since the policy or the validator are defined via their class name and dynamically loaded, it is
                     important that you make sure that the identified class is available to the application server. One
                     way
                     to accomplish that is to deploy your policy implementation as the JAR file in your AS instance deploy
                     directory. Note also that, since both policies and validators are dynamically instantiated, they
                     must
                     provide a default, no-argument constructor.

            interpretations, resulting in interoperability issues. It is therefore possible to encounter issues when
            using consumers from different vendors. We have experienced such issues and have introduced a way to relax
            the validation that our WSRP producer performs on the data provided by consumers to help with
            interoperability by accepting data that would normally be invalid. Note that we only relax our validation
            algorithm on aspects of the specification that are deemed harmless, such as invalid language codes.
         </p><p>
            By default, the WSRP producer is configured in the strict mode. If you experience issues with a given consumer,
            you might want to try to relax the validation mode. This is accomplished by unchecking the "Use strict WSRP
            compliance." checkbox on the Producer configuration screen.
